# Project title: AI Visionary
This project tends to give visually impaired people an independence to walk on the roads without any living assistance. 

# How it works:
The users phone camera takes the input and processes it to find any obstacles in the path of the user and intimate the user over the voice
telling what object is there in front of the user and at what distance and the intensity of danger that the object could cause to the user.
Ex: A cat in front of a person is less dangerous compared to an approching car, our system differentiate it and conveys it to the user after prioritising.

We have also incorporated a fall detection system embedded in the app that we have created it uses the accelerometer in the phone to catch the unusual vibrations
so if the user falls down or meets with an accident it conveys the location of the user to their relavtive.

loacation of the user convaed to the relative.

This web application is embedded in the mobile application for faster accessing.
